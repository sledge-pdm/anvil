Anvil is the pixel buffer processing package for [sledge](https://github.com/sledge-pdm/sledge).

## Features

* Flexible diff management (pixel/partial/whole)
* Tile states management
* WASM buffer operations

## The Goal

* Memory efficient buffer operations
* Simple interfaces

> After all I want to do the same thing as [sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/) does (but without using libvips which causes many problem in tauri)
